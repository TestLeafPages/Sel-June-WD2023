   Parameterization:

   1. Identify the data in the feature file
       -username,password
   2. Surround the data with ''
   3. Replace the data which is surrounded with '' as {string} in the StepDefintion
   4. Pass input arguments to the method and replace the hardcoded data with the argum


How to pass multiple data using ScenarioOutline:
1. To pass multiple data for a single scenario the Ghekin keyword used is Scenario Outline
2. In Scenario Outline identify the dynamic data and replace that with <>
    ex: <companyname>
3. Under Examples keyword create pipeline symbol and mention the column name
   ex: |companyname|
   Note: The nae should exactly match
    -Pass the values in the second row of Examples
    ex: |TestLeaf12|  (1st set of data)
        |Qeagle34|    (2nd set of data)

4.Go to the StepDefinition and replace <companyname> with (.*)$
5.Pass Input arguments to the method and replace the hardcoded value withe the argument

@Before
@After


InvalidMethodException

Step1
Create -BaseClass
Give driver as gobally with static keyword
create Precondition & postcondition and give @beforemethod ,@aftermethod

step2
extends Base class to step-class and runner class

Step3
Command common line in feature file
